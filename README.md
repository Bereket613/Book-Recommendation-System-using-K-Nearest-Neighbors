# Book Recommendation System using K-Nearest Neighbors

## Overview
This project implements a book recommendation system based on the Book-Crossings dataset. The system uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to recommend books that are similar to a given book title. The data includes ratings of over 270,000 books by 90,000 users. The KNN model helps in finding the "closeness" of books based on user ratings.

## Project Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Import and clean the Book-Crossings dataset.
   - Filter out books with fewer than 100 ratings and users with fewer than 200 ratings.
   
2. **Creating a Book-User Rating Matrix**:
   - Pivot the dataset into a book-user matrix where each row represents a book and each column a user, with ratings as values.
   
3. **KNN Model**:
   - Use the `NearestNeighbors` algorithm from Scikit-learn to build the recommendation model.
   - The model computes cosine similarity between books based on their user ratings.
   
4. **Book Recommendations**:
   - Given a book title, the function `get_recommends` returns the top 5 similar books with their respective distances.
