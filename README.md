# Book-Recommendation-System-using-K-Nearest-Neighbors
This project builds a book recommendation system using the Book-Crossings dataset. It applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to suggest similar books based on user ratings. The system preprocesses the data, uses KNN for recommendations, and demonstrates creating a recommendation engine with Python and Scikit-learn.
